# for loop statement and range() function execute code a certain number of times
# In code, a for statement looks something like for i in range(5): and includes the following:
# The for keyword
# A variable name
# The in keyword
# A call to the range() method with up to three integers passed to it
# A colon
# Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the for clause)

# print ('My name is')
# for i in range (5):
#     print ('Jimmy Five Times('+str(i)+')')

# The variable i will go up to, but will not include, the integer passed to range()
# In fact, you can use continue and break statements only inside while and for loops.
# If you try to use these statements elsewhere, Python will give you an error.

# total = 0
# for num in range(101):
#     total = total + num
# print(total)

# print ('My name is')
# i = 0
# while (i < 5):
#     print('Jimmy Five Times('+str(i)+')')
#     i = i+1

# for i in range(12, 16):
#     print(i)

# The first argument will be where the for loopâ€™s variable starts,
# and the second argument will be up to, but not including, the number to stop at.
# range() function can also have 3 arguments. First two are stop and start values.
# Third is the step argument or amount that variable increases by

# for i in range(0,10,2):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(5, -1, -1):
#     print(i)
