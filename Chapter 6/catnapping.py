# Multiline Strings with Triple Quotes
# Any quotes, tabs, or newlines in between the triple quotes are considered part of the string

print('''Dear Alice,

Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burglary, and extortion.

Sincerely,
Bob\n''')

# Code that prints the same thing but uses escape characters instead of the multiline string:
print('Dear Alice, \n\nEve\'s cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burglary, and extortion.\n\nSincerely,\nBob')
