# method is the same thing as a function but it is called on a value
# spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
# print(spam.index('hello'))
# print(spam.index('heyas'))
# print(spam.index('howdy howdy howdy')) #ValueError

# When there are duplicates of the value in the list, the index of its first appearance is returned.

# spam = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Fat-tail', 'Pooka']
# print(spam.index('Pooka'))


# To add new values to a list, use the append and insert methods
# spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']
# spam.append('moose')
# print(spam)
# the append method adds the argument to the end of the list
# The insert method can add a value at any index in the list
# First argument to insert() is the index for the new value, the second argument is the new value to be inserted
# spam = ['cat','dog','bat']
# spam.insert(1, 'chicken')
# print(spam)

# AttributeError
# eggs = 'hello'
# eggs.append('world')

# bacon = 42
# bacon.insert(1, 'world')
