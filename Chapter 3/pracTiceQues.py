# Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
# Functions organize code into miniprograms, reduce the need for duplicate code, and its easier to fix and read.

# When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?
# when the function is called

# What statement creates a function?
# def (defines a function which creates it)

# What is the difference between a function and a function call?
# A function call runs through the path of the functions in order and executes everything and evaluates a return value
# and a function is a def statement with code.

# How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
# There is 1 global scope and a local scope when you create one

# What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
# Variables in a local scope after the function returns are destroyed and forgotten

# What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?
# A return value is the value the expression evaluates to.
# Yes a return value can be part of an expression

# If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
#  return None

# How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?
# Use the global statement

# What is the data type of None?
# NoneType data set

# What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?
# It imports the file and all its code or data.

# If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
# call spam.bacon()

# How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?
# You can use the try and except clause to stop it from crashing (place code in a try clause)

# What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?
# Code that may cause an error goes in the try clause.
# In the except clause goes the code that will execute if there is an error.
